# Talk Slides with [Spectacle](https://formidable.com/open-source/spectacle/)

This is a WIP. I considered using it for a talk and found the process to be too complicated/undocumented. But I'm keeping the repo around for later use.

## Setup

To build the slides locally, clone the repo from GitHub:

```
git clone git@github.com:marcysutton/pinterest-inclusive-frontend.git
cd pinterest-inclusive-frontend
```

Install dependencies:

```
$ npm install
```

## Run slides locally

```
$ npm start
```

You should be able to view the slides at `http://localhost:3000`.
